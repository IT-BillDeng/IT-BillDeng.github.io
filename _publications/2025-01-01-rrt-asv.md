We present **RRT\*ASV**, an RRT*-based planner tailored for Ackermann steering vehicles. Kinematics-aware pruning, informed sampling, and Dijkstra pre-processing accelerate convergence and yield smoother, feasible paths under steering constraints; evaluations in Expert Systems with Applications highlight the planning gains.
