Abstract: The path planning of the Ackermann steering vehicle needs to take into account the driving safety and following feasibility of the vehicle. Many path planners consider the feasibility of following a set of curvilinear paths using the maximum vehicle steering constraint. However, existing methods are usually limited by the accuracy of the meshing or the discontinuity of the route curvature, which makes vehicle path following control challenging. A sampling-based planner is proposed under the concept of a pre-existing road network model, along with an optimal path planning algorithm considering the motion constraints of Ackermann Steer Vehicles, named Rapidly-exploring Random Tree Star for Ackermann Steer Vehicles (RRT*ASV). Specifically, a weighted directed graph model of road networks is constructed by defining vertex rules and using the Dijkstra algorithm to generate a sequence of vertices from the starting point to the target point. On this basis, the Pure Pursuit (PP) algorithm is proposed to generate the arc path and give the direction to the new state point, the Dubins curve is used to complete the rewiring, and the turning cost function is proposed to reduce the sharp turning path. The proposed algorithm was evaluated for performance in a simulation environment and validated for feasibility on a physical platform. The evaluation outcomes demonstrate that among various paths tracked by the Ackermann steering vehicle, the reference path generated by RRT*ASV exhibits the lowest lateral tracking error of 0.025 m, and significantly alleviates the controller load by at least 60.66% when compared to the baseline algorithms.
