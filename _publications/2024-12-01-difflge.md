We propose **DiffLGE**, a diffusion-based pipeline to generate high-quality LGE CMR images without gadolinium. Diffusion modeling avoids GAN instability and mode collapse while conditioning on CINE + T1 mapping to preserve anatomy and pathology, reducing contrast agent usage with realistic, high-resolution output.
