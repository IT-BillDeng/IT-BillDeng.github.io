## 🎯 What I'm Looking For
Applying for PhD programs (targeting 2026 Fall) and seeking advisors in computer vision and autonomous driving. Especially interested in perception and representation learning for robust driving stacks, and bringing generative/vision-language techniques into scene understanding.

## 🔍 Research Interests
Autonomous driving perception (multi-sensor fusion/BEV/3D tracking) and planning/control for Ackermann vehicles; generative and vision-language models to improve robustness, domain adaptation, and uncertainty in driving scenes; diffusion/SAM-style methods for medical imaging generation and segmentation.

## 📰 Selected Publications

1. **DiffLGE**: Diffusion-based LGE CMR synthesis with CINE + T1 conditioning; outperforms GAN baselines on private cohort. *IEEE BIBM 2024*.
2. **Text-Prompted EAT Segmentation**: SAM adaptation with text prompts + pseudo-mask augmentation for data-scarce cardiac MRI. *IEEE BIBM 2024*.
3. **RRT\*ASV**: Road-network seeded, PP/Dubins-guided RRT* variant; achieves 0.025 m lateral error and cuts controller load by 60.66%. *Expert Systems With Applications, 2025*.
