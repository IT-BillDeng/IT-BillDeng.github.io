Projects
======
* **Diffusion-Based Image Generation for Synthesizing Late Gadolinium Enhancement Scans**, 2024  
  Proposed DiffLGE to synthesize high-quality LGE CMR images without gadolinium contrast; conditioned a stable diffusion framework on CINE and T1 mapping data.
* **Epicardial Adipose Tissue Segmentation in MRIs Using Text-Prompted Pretraining Model**, 2024  
  Adapted SAM with text prompts for EAT segmentation; leveraged public datasets, pseudo-labeling, and fine-tuning on private data to handle scarcity.
* **3D Medical Image Report Generation Based on Vision-Language Mixture of Expert Model**, 2025  
  Combined vision-language large models to generate clinical reports for 3D medical images; optimized pipeline and mixture-of-experts design for quality.
* **Path Planning for Vehicles Based on Improved RRT* Algorithm** (Undergraduate Thesis), 2023  
  Integrated Ackermann steering constraints, used Dijkstra on road networks for shortest paths, and pruned RRT* search space to accelerate convergence.
* **Intelligent Vehicle Technology Verification Platform**, 2022  
  Guangdong Provincial Department of Science and Technology 2020 Major Project: built motion capture/positioning, deployed embedded system, debugged hardware, and designed line-following algorithm.
* **One-stop Information Subscription Platform for University Students (WeChat Mini Program)**, 2022  
  Published class/course announcements and managed assignment notifications; piloted with 200+ users. Led planning, architecture, full-stack development, and white-box testing.
* **Real-time Detection of Insulator Defects on Transmission Lines Based on a Lightweight Improved YOLOv5s Algorithm**, 2022  
  Developed an enhanced YOLOv5s pipeline for drone-captured insulator defect detection across varied resolutions and complex natural scenes.
